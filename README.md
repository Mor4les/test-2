# Supreme Manga

![alt text](https://github.com/fukouda/Supreme-Manga/blob/master/imgs/cover/3.png "Manga Cover")

### Summary
A manga-reading site built in PHP. Utilises the 'mangascrape' public API to pull data from http://mangafox.me, http://mangareader.net, and http://mangastream.com.

Consequently, Supreme Manga loads a responsive web interface using Bootstrap to present the data from the API. This lets it function like a manga reader.

### Version
0.0.1

### Resources

Supreme Manga uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) - Used to create the UI
* [Unirest.io](https://github.com/Mashape/unirest-php) - Used to call the API
* [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) - Not currently, but soon
