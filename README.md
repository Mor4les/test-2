# Supreme Manga - Deprecated!

__I haven't had the time to maintain this project lately since I've been going to school full-time and looking for work. The API has also been taken down, the code is still up to view; however it is now deprecated.__

### Summary
A manga-reading site built in PHP. Utilises the 'mangascrape' public API to pull data from http://mangafox.me, http://mangareader.net, and http://mangastream.com.

Consequently, Supreme Manga loads a responsive web interface using Bootstrap to present the data from the API. This lets it function like a manga reader.

### Version
0.0.2

### Resources

Supreme Manga uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) - Used to create the UI
* [Unirest.io](https://github.com/Mashape/unirest-php) - Used to call the API
* [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) - Not currently, but soon
